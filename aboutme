Hello,

I am a vascular access registered nurse at an HCA facility in Nashville, Tennessee. I believe that through my years of clinical experience, I have had sufficient exposure to real-world processes and problems that could be improved or changed in order to help our patient outcomes. I hope that through learning to code, I can do just this!

In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching all sports, drinking coffee on the porch on a cool, autumn morning, a good old-fashioned, hanging out with my friends and roommates, and traveling as often as possible. 

I'm very much so a beginner at coding and am open to any and all guidance. Feel free to contact me at andrewlouiswhittaker@gmail.com.

All the best, 
Drew
